Documentation for the Munchkin Bot by Jupp56 and Olfi01

Inserting new cards:

New cards have to be inserted into the sql card database.
They have different attributes to specify their behaviour. Some Cards (especially some of the advanced actions) may be not possible just to code via database arguments.
If you want to contribute to fitting them in, feel free to alter our code and make a push request, we thank you in advance for every contribution.
